# Inject 2.0 AI ChatBot by Joseph Straight - Manual QA Testing

## Introduction

This repository contains comprehensive Manual Quality Assurance (QA) testing of the Inject 2.0 AI ChatBot. The ChatBot is designed to function as a manual for the Inject 2.0 application developed by Greg Rostami. It's purpose is to answer user queries and questions related to the application and its manual. 

You can interact with the ChatBot [HERE](https://www.chatbase.co/chatbot-iframe/JDi3xTNl_xzc22kl6h-Yf).

## Purpose

The purpose of this QA testing is to investigate if the ChatBot responds purposefully to the userâ€™s questions, assess its comprehension of the application (Inject 2.0 System by Greg Rostami), its ability to provide accurate responses, and the quality of the user experience it offers.

## Test Scenarios and Cases

The QA testing involves a variety of test scenarios and cases, including:

1. Verifying the chatbot's ability to understand complex multi-turn conversations/questions related to Inject 2.0.
2. Evaluating the chatbot's ability to handle queries related to the Inject 2.0 Manual.
3. Testing the chatbot's response to different user sentiments.
4. Assessing the chatbot's ability to handle interruptions in a conversation flow.
5. Testing the chatbot's fallback strategy when it fails to understand user input.

Detailed test cases and results for each scenario can be found in the 'Test Cases' directory.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Inject 2.0 AI ChatBot serves its main purpose effectively - answering user queries related to the Inject 2.0 application and its manual. However, there are a few areas that require attention. The ChatBot occasionally fails to provide complete information, missing out on explaining some features in depth, such as the "qp qm" feature and the time delay option of the covert typing in Inject. The ChatBot also struggles to handle interruptions in a conversation flow, which could be improved by incorporating a mechanism for stopping the generation of a response when an interruption occurs.

The fallback strategy of the ChatBot when it fails to understand user input is appropriately polite and prompts the user to provide more details or rephrase their question. 

Based on the findings of this report, enhancements to the ChatBot's comprehension of the application's features and its ability to handle conversation interruptions are recommended. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the user experience and performance of the Inject 2.0 AI ChatBot.

Despite these areas for improvement, the ChatBot is deemed ready for use with the understanding that improvements will continue to be made in the areas highlighted in this report.

## Future Improvements

1. Enhance the ChatBot's comprehension of the application's features.
2. Improve the ChatBot's ability to handle conversation interruptions.
3. Continue to make improvements in the areas highlighted in this report.
